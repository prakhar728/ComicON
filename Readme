# 🦸‍♂️ ComicOn

**ComicOn** is a Farcaster-native bot that turns real conversations into mintable comic strips. Just tag `@ComicOn` in any thread, and we’ll instantly turn the last two messages into a comic — coined on Zora, and buyable right from your feed.

## ✨ How It Works

1. **Tag the Bot**: Mention `@ComicOn` in a Farcaster conversation.
2. **We Listen**: Using Neynar, we fetch the last two messages in the thread.
3. **Comicify**: Those messages get turned into a funny, expressive comic script.
4. **Mint it on Zora**: We generate the comic, coin it using the Zora SDK.
5. **Post Instantly**: The comic is posted with an embedded with it's CA.
6. **Buy Instantly**: You can buy using Uniswap v4 / the Zora Page / or using Clankr and Bankr.


## 🎯 Why ComicOn?

Social media is full of magic moments — jokes, debates, and banter. We capture that *in the moment* and let you own it forever.

- 🧠 **Frictionless**: Just tag — no setup, no app, no wallet dancing.
- 🎨 **Memetic**: Comics are visual, emotional, and highly shareable.
- 💸 **Onchain-native**: Every post is an NFT. Mintable. Tradeable. Ownable.
- 💰 **Aligned Incentives**: We earn through Zora referral fees, not through user extraction.

## 💼 Business Model

Every time someone mints a comic, we earn a Zora referral fee. As ComicOn moments spread and go viral, we scale with them.

## 🤝 Built With

- **Farcaster + Neynar API** – For social graph and post reading
- **Zora SDK** – Mint and coin NFTs onchain
- **Clankr / Bankr** – Simple, embedded mint UX in social feeds
- **TypeScript, Node.js** – Backend & bot logic

## 🛠️ Future Plans

- Revenue share with conversation participants
- Farcaster Frames for caption voting or remixing
- "Comic of the Day" leaderboard
- Series tracking and multi-panel stories

## 📸 Example

> Conversation:
> - User1: "Why did the smart contract break up with the front-end?"
> - User2: "It needed more space!"

ComicOn generates and mints this as a 1-of-1 collectible comic.
